first we do make_blobs
## The make_blobs function from sklearn.datasets is used to generate a synthetic dataset with clusters of data points. 
## and used the kMean++ Algorithm.K-means++ is an algorithm used to initialize the centroids in the K-means clustering algorithm. 
## By Manual Through Elbow Method we choose the cluster and through the graph the best cluster is k=3;
## Also used the Automatic Method "KneeLocator" to find the Cluster and it give the best cluster is 3.
## And check the performance and it give the best performance value on 3.silhouette score is a metric commonly used to evaluate the performance of clustering algorithms, including K-means clustering. It provides a measure of how well each data point is clustered, ranging from -1 to 1.
